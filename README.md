## ⚙️ Functionality

The project functions as a compact experimentation platform with:

### 🎮 Round Simulation

* Random outcome generation with adjustable win probability.
* Flexible control over the number of rounds.
* Live updates and result tracking.

### 📊 Strategy Analysis

* Test multiple betting strategies under identical conditions.
* Compare final balances, volatility, drawdowns, and max stake size.
* Generate clean, readable summaries for each strategy.

### 🛠 Customizable Parameters

* Starting bankroll.
* Base bet size.
* Win probability.
* Strategy configuration and coefficients.

### 🧪 Experimental Sandbox

* Model different betting scenarios.
* Study long-distance behavior and risk exposure.
* Quickly prototype new strategy ideas without noise.

## 📁 What’s Inside

* **simulator** — tiny random outcome engine.
* **strategies** — core auto-betting strategies.
* **bot** — runs comparisons and prints results.
* **README** — clear, simple documentation.

The structure is intentionally lightweight for readability and learning.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Adjustable parameters for full control of the simulation.
* Multiple pre-built strategies.
* Detailed results with risk metrics.
* Clean, minimal codebase.

## 🧠 Why Use This

Auto-betting strategies often look “smart” until you see how they perform over hundreds or thousands of rounds.
This repo helps you visualize:

* where strategies fail,
* how risk grows over time,
* why bankroll management is critical,
* why no strategy guarantees profit.

It’s a mathematical, analytical playground.

If you want, I can:

* rewrite the README in a more professional or playful tone,
* add GitHub-style badges, banners, or branding,
* create a short project tagline or marketing blurb,
* restructure the doc like a premium open-source project.
